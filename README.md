#### This JavaScript, HTML, & CSS practice project is a simple ordering flow. The landing page is a menu of three items which can be added and removed from a checkout window. When checking out, billing information is collected and an order object is created ready to be sent to the backend and an item and ingredients object is created ready to be sent to the restaurant. 

## Possible next steps
#### Find a resturant api that I could fetch a real menu from and add a try and catch block to my handleSubmitOrder function.
