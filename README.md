### This JavaScript, HTML, & CSS practice was completed over two days and is a simple ordering flow. The landing page is a menu of three items which can be added and removed from a checkout window. When checking out, billing information is collected and an order object is created ready to be sent to the backend and an item and ingredients object is created ready to be sent to the restaurant.
